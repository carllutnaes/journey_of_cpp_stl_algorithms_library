# A Journey of The C++ STL Algorithms Library

## Inspiration
Jonathan Boccara's CppCon 2018 talk *"105 STL Algorithms in Less Than an Hour"* inspired me to do the journey through the Algorithm Library myself.

 **Boccaras talk:** [CppCon 2018: Jonathan Boccara “105 STL Algorithms in Less Than an Hour”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2olsGf6JIkU&feature=emb_title)

## Journey
A comprehensive journey through the C++ STL algorithms library. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate use of each STL algorithm atleast once (as of C++17).

Current state of the journey is **8 of 105** algorithms, and I am in the Lands of Permutations.

 <!--2. Lands of Queries
 3. Islands of Structure Changes
 4. Peninsula of Raw Memory
 5. Land of Value Modifiers
 6. Territory of Movers
 7. Glorious County of Algos on Sets-->


## Notes
C++ STL Algorithm Library Reference: [https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm)

Compiling using Apple Clang so the code includes some C++20 features.
